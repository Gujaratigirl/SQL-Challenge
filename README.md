# SQL-Challenge

##Started work with PGAdmin and SQL
The application can easily manipulate the data and is easy on the syntax.  Even when the syntax or code is wrong PGAdmin gives very useful error notes.

For this homework the goal was to manipulate the csv file with the help of PGAdmin.  

First I looked at the csv files in VScode so that I could get a basic understanding of what I was going to create.  This allowed me to make the 6 starter tables.

I was then able to join and find the specific information that the homework required.

With simple code I was able to pull only pertinent data from the tables and leave out redundent and unnecessary data.

Is excersice was a great introduction to Sql and PGAdmin.


I was not able to work on this project over the week therefore I do not have a lot of commits for this project.
